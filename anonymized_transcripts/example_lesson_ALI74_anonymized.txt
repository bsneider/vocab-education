[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect. So, we have two more words <DATE_TIME>. Do you know what conscience means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Conscience? Mm-hmm. I'm not so conscious means that part of you that judges how moral your own actions are and makes you feel guilty about bad things that you have done or things you feel responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, have you, have you ever watched <PERSON>? Yes, but I didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one of the conversations, <PERSON> tells his son before he goes into a duel and says, you don't want this young man's blood on your conscience. So that means you don't want to kill this guy because your conscience is forever going to tell you that, oh, you have this young man's blood on your hands and you're, you're going to feel guilty about it for the rest of your life. Um, or for example, when I stole, um, a piece, when I stole, um, a <NRP> fry from my friend's plate, my conscience will tell me to be honest and tell her that I stole her <NRP> fry so conscious conscience is the part of you like guilty as charged exactly so the part of you that judges how moral you are or conscience is, conscience is the part of feeling bad. Yes. That makes you feel guilty about something not very good that you've done. So could you make a sentence with conscience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Conscience. I have, I feel conscious for eating the last donut. Yes, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say, eating, sorry, eating a sorry what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eating a donut. Eating, eating a donut. I feel conscious for eating the last donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm. So you could say that, um, eating the last donut is on my conscience. So conscience is like a place is like that part of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like think of conscience, like the little voice in your head. Um, that makes you feel guilty that that's like, Hey, you did something wrong. You should think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so conscience is that part of you. that gives out that little voice. Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel conscience. I was conscious for eating the last donut. Hmm. Think of conscience more like a place. When I ate the last donut, I went to conscience. Okay, I love that you did literally go to the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, how about think of conscience as your moral friend who lives in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel conscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your conscience tells you that it's wrong to eat the last donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: because so- My conscience said I shouldn't have ate the last donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of conscience. Oh, conscience is like your moral crinch, y'all. So think of conscience as like your imaginary friend who like judges the little things that you do.
