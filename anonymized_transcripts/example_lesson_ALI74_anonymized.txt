[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it started. So, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, very good. You've got a morsel of bread, bread. That's awesome. I love that you remember the word morsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome. We're gonna jump into the cab. And we're just gonna go over some words that we went that we that we had for <PERSON> Since <DATE_TIME> is <DATE_TIME> So do you remember what delirious means? Yes, like not thinking right or speak clearly. You're seeing things. You're restless. You can't, you can't insist. Yes. All right. Keepsake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keepsake means like something that's super precious to you. Like my iPad is like keepsake. Yes. Exactly. What about amenity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amenity? Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A manatee is like a type of animal. And it's very big. It's massive. And it lives in the water. Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like a seacow. It's a large sea animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what odorous means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something that doesn't smell good. Yep. So having a smell, having a smell. All right. We covered this last time. Do you remember what amphibious means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a manatee is not amphibious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that can live underwater and on land. Yes. Amphibious means the ability to be able to live both on land and in water. Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right. And we know what morsel means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes. Yes, it means
[SPEAKER_00]: Food. A small amount of food. Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small piece. Like this small. Yes, like that small. A food. Usually a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect. So, we have two more words <DATE_TIME>. Do you know what conscience means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Conscience? I'm right. So conscious means that part of you that judges how moral your own actions are and makes you feel guilty about bad things that you have done or things you feel responsible for. So have you have you ever watched <PERSON>?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but I didn't understand it. That's okay. So in one of the conversations <PERSON> tells his son before he goes into a duel and says, you don't want this young man's blood on your conscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means you don't want to kill this guy because your conscience is forever going to tell you that, oh, you have this young man's blood on your hands and you're going to feel guilty about it for the rest of your life. Or for example, when I stole a piece, when I stole a <NRP> fry from my friend's plate, My conscience will tell me to be honest and tell her that I stole her <NRP> fry. So, conscience is the part of you... Like guilty as charged. Exactly. So, the part of you that judges how moral you are. or conscience is conscience is the part of feeling bad. Yes. That makes you feel guilty about something not very good that you've done. So could you make a sentence with conscience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Conscience? I have, I feel conscious for eating last donut. Yes, perfect. So you could say, um, uh, eating, sorry, eating a, sorry, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eating a donut. Eating, eating. I feel conscious for eating the last donut. Hmm. So you could say that, um, eating the last donut is on my conscience. So conscience is like a place is like that part of you. So like think of conscience, like the little voice in your head, um, that makes you feel guilty. That that's like, Hey, you did something wrong. You should think about it. Um, so conscience is that part of you. That gives out that little voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right. So I feel conscious. I was conscious for eating the last donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of conscious more like a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I ate the last donut, I went to conscious. Okay, I love that you did literally go to the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay. How about think of conscience as your moral friend who lives in your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel conscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your conscience tells you that it's wrong to eat the last donut. because so- My conscience said I shouldn't have ate the last donut. Yeah, exactly. So think of conscience. Oh, conscience is like your moral crincia. So think of conscience as like your imaginary friend who like judges the little things that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect. So do you know what unearth means? Unearth. Unearth? Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No. On <LOCATION>?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on <LOCATION>?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long possibility. I like that. So, almost. Except remember when we learned prefixes? Yes. Pre-on. Un or pre-in. Yes. So do you remember what the prefix on means? You're not on the <LOCATION>. You're not. Yes. On earth. So not earth. So think of like earth could be like ground. Right. So think of on earth being like you digging things out of the ground. So you unearth it unearth the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that could be one of the things. So unearth technically means to discover something in the ground. So you can think of unearth as digging in the ground, so that there's no earth there anymore. So you unearth it. So you could unearth a pile of gold coins, or you can say, I unearthed, ooh. I unearthed a treasure box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes. I unearthed the capsule. Yes. Under the ground. A time capsule could be one of the things that you unearthed. Perfect.
